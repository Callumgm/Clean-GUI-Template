## What have I changed in the auth system?
I have removed the HWID Auth system and replaced it with a very simple Password and Username system.
I have made this very simple so there is no remember me button yet because I had to remove it currently, in the feature maybe I will re-add it again!

## Requirements
You need to delete the Remember me label and checkbox and the HWID Label too, as I have previously stated this is a very simple auth version so it does not have a rememeber me function yet, Go to line 81 & 82 in the "FrmLogin.cs" file to change the username and password (Simply put in a new pastebin link with your passwords and usernames). You also need Visual Studio 2019 not 2022

## To-do List ❌=Not done yet, ✅=Done
- Remember me function.❌
- Register system.❌
- How to login page rework.❌
- Fetch Usernames and Passwords from Pastebin instead of HWID.✅
