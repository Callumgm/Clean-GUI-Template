## What have I changed in the auth system?
I have removed the HWID Auth system and replaced it with a very simple Password and Username system.
Also huge thanks to the Owner of the original repository for helping me re-add the Remember me button and fix minor bugs!

## Requirements
You need to delete the HWID Label, as I have previously stated this is a very simple auth version so it does not have a rememeber me function yet, Go to line 81 & 82 in the "FrmLogin.cs" file to change the username and password (Simply put in a new pastebin link with your passwords and usernames). You also need Visual Studio 2019 not 2022

## To-do List ‚ùå=Not done yet, ‚úÖ=Done, üü°=Already inculded in a different feature.
- Remember me function.‚úÖ
- Register system.üü°
- Fetch Usernames and Passwords from Pastebin instead of HWID.‚úÖ
