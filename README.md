## What have I changed in the auth system?
I have removed the HWID Auth system and replaced it with a very simple Password and Username system.
I have made this very simple so there is no remember me button yet because I had to remove it currently, in the feature maybe I will re-add it again!

## Change Log
### 22/05/20222
- Added Simple "animation" when hovering over the close and other little white buttons
- Removed HWID from whole project and changed to just PC username and passwords
- Fixed a bunch of minor errors when trying to build the project
